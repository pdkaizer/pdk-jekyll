Last year on this day I <a href="/ten-years-later-a-reflection/">wrote this post</a>. The wishes I expressed last year seem even more relevant today.

Eleven years later:<br />
I wish that we could be transformed to care more about the most marginalized people around the world. 

Eleven years later:<br />
I wish that this nation could be transformed to better care for its poorest and most vulnerable citizens. 

Eleven years later:<br />
I hope and pray that the human family can be transformed and stop hurting each other in the name of God and spiritual beliefs.
