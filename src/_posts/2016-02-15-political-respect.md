Back in March of 2010 [I wrote this post](/just-plain-old-disrespect/) about what I considered to be a flagrantly disrespectful display of political opinion. Well American polictics have certainly not gotten any more respectfull in recent years which is why this [piece on Justice Ginsburg’s moving tribute to her friend Justice Scalia](http://www.vox.com/2016/2/14/10990156/scalia-ginsburg-friends) is such a breath of fresh air.

One can only hope that this will be a celebrated example to more as the battle to replace Justice Scalia commences and this election cycle continues.
