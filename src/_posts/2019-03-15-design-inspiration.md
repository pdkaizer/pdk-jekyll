Veerle Pieters has been a favorite designer of mine for many years. In this recent post she talks about how the latest version of her georgeous blog came to life.

As a designer who is always wanting to do a design overhaul of my site this piece really hits home. Some of Veerle's quotes that really resonate with me are:

<blockquote class="external">"Instead Iâ€™ve only created the fragments or parts of pages, the rest I directly created with CSS. For me this was the most flexible and productive way to finalise the design."</blockquote>

<blockquote class="external">"My advice to anyone thinking about a personal brand redesign is to be patient with the process."</blockquote>

<blockquote class="external">"Try to enjoy the process and embrace the chaos!"</blockquote>
