title: 'Fish and Vegetables'

---

<p>This past weekend my wife and I had a small dinner party to celebrate our friend Laura's birthday. Since it was in her honor I decided I would ask Laura what she wanted for dinner. Much to my chagrin the answer I got was "fish and vegetables." I have nothing against either fish or vegetables but as someone who has been on a meat kick - think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossobuco">Osso Buco</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_ribs">Short Ribs</a> - her request took some of the wind out of my sails.</p>

<p>For inspiration, I turned to a new cookbook that my wife gave me as gift recently, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gourmet-Today-All-New-Recipes-Contemporary/dp/0618610189/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1268104972&sr=8-1">Gourmet Today: More than 1000 All-New Recipes for the Contemporary Kitchen</a>, edited by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Reichl">Ruth Reichl</a>. I found a slow roasted glazed salmon recipe that looked interesting and had the richness and depth of flavor I was looking for. The glaze is predominantly red wine with some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirin">mirin</a>, - sweet Japanese cooking wine - soy, ginger juice and a bit of brown sugar all reduced to a syrupy glaze. A squeeze of limejuice added just the right touch of acid to the burgundy colored glaze. </p>

<p>For the vegetable dish, Gourmet Today had a recipe for baby bok choy with ginger stir-fry that I thought would compliment the flavors of the salmon. I rounded the menu out with brown jasmine rice pilaf with saut√©ed onions and celery and topped with toasted sliced almonds.</p>

<p>At the farmers market, early on the morning of the party, I spied some wonderful looking watercress and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosc_Pear">Bosc pears</a> so I decided too add a salad of watercress, pears, toasted walnuts and Gorgonzola cheese as a first course.</p>

<p>For an appetizer I made shrimp toast, small pieces of shrimp marinated in ginger, garlic, mirin, soy and cilantro and then spread on a thin slab of bread and baked.</p>

<p>So the next time someone requests fish and vegetables I won't be so put off. The party was a great success and everyone enjoyed the food.</p>
