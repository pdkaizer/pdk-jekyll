<p>My dear friends Nancy & Bob gave me a copy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Keller">Chef Thomas Kellers's</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ad-Hoc-Home-Thomas-Keller/dp/1579653774/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1267375284&sr=8-1">Ad Hoc at Home</a> cookbook this past holiday season.  This Sunday morning I woke up craving the fabulous looking buttermilk biscuits I had seen while first exploring the book.  Much to my sleepy wifeâ€™s delight, I jumped out of bed early to shop for the few ingredients I didn't already have in the pantry.</p>

<p>Those of you who are familiar with Chef Keller and his cookbooks, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/French-Laundry-Cookbook-Thomas-Keller/dp/1579651267/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1267375637&sr=8-1">The French Laundry Cookbook</a> among others, know that his recipes can be a challenge for the home cook.  The whole premise of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ad-Hoc-Home-Thomas-Keller/dp/1579653774/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1267375284&sr=8-1">Ad Hoc at Home</a> and the <a href="http://www.adhocrestaurant.com/index.php">restaurant</a> it comes from is &mdash; I believe &mdash; to present food and recipes that are more accessible.</p>

<p>The buttermilk biscuits were very easy to make.  As I didn't have the two-inch ring cutter that Keller called for to make rounds I chose instead to cut the dough into squares. I also decided to sprinkle just a bit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleur_de_sel">Fleur de sel</a> on the tops after brushing them with melted butter, as the recipe called for, as soon as they came out of the oven. </p>

<p>We ate them warm with a little raspberry jam and <a href="http://www.strategicconversations.net/">my wife</a> & I both agreed that they were probably the best biscuits we had ever had. They were soft and just flakey enough, sweet from the butter in the dough with just a hint of tang from the buttermilk.</p>

<p><strong>Update: here is the recipe for those who asked</strong></p>

<p><strong>Buttermilk Biscuits</strong></p>

<p>2 cups cake flour<br />
2 cups all-purpose flour<br />
1 tablespoon kosher salt<br />
1 tablespoon baking powder<br />
1 teaspoon baking soda<br />
2 sticks unsalted butter (cut into 1/2 inch cubes)<br />
1 1/2 cups buttermilk<br />
2 tablespoons melted butter</p>

<p>Preheat oven to 425&deg; Line baking sheet with parchment paper</p>

<p>Combine the flours, salt baking powder & soda in a food processor and pulse a few times. Add butter and pulse to make butter pieces fine grained.</p>

<p>Transfer to a large bowl, make a well in the center and add buttermilk.  Mix to just combine. On a floured surface pat the dough into a 3/4 think rectangle.  Cut into rounds or square, place on parchment covered baking sheet, brush tops with a bit on extra buttermilk.</p>

<p>Bake for 15 - 18 minutes, until golden brown.  Remove from oven and  immediately brush tops with a bit of melted butter.  Sprinkle with a bit of Fluer de sel.</p>
