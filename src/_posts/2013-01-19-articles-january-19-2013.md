summary: First edition of the weekly articles of interest post.
---

I save a lot of articles I find online to the really great [Readability](https://www.readability.com) service to read later - usually I read them on the very nice Readability app for the iPad. Something new I am going start and try to do weekly is post a group of the most interesting here. I am linking to them on readability so you get a nicely formatted page that can be printed or viewed online. Welcome to the inaugural edition.

[**Design Practice:The Design Lesson**](https://www.readability.com/articles/elcggeg7)<br />
[Andy Rutledge](http://andyrutledge.com/) first published this piece in Sept. 2010. He has since rewritten it a bit and it's definitely worth a read. I am sure that Andy and I would disagree on anything related to politics but on design and design practice he is spot on.

[**Scaling Your UX Strategy**](https://www.readability.com/articles/nhhdeb6m)<br />
An interesting look at ways that User Experience (UX) is finding it's way into the enterprise.

[**Show Your Code: Use Github to Maintain Your Code Portfolio**](https://www.readability.com/articles/asvi6fwa)<br />
Since I am currently enamored of [GitHub](https://github.com/) and moving my design and development workflow to it this nice overview piece is of particular interest.

[**20 top web design and development trends for 2013**](https://www.readability.com/articles/uvw8oze0)<br />
An interesting look at what might be the top web design and development trends for the coming year.

[**From lame to Lionâ€”the 12-year evolution of OS X**](https://www.readability.com/articles/ufrhnxh9)<br />
An interesting look back at the evolution of the Mac OS X operating system.
