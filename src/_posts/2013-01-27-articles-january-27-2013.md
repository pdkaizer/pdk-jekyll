This weeks articles of interest all focus in some way on front-end web design, markup and performance.

[**Structural Semantics The Importance Of HTML5 Sectioning Elements**](https://www.readability.com/articles/zmlebiks)<br />
An in depth look at the semantic nature of html5 sectioning elements. I need to incorporate these more into my mark up.

[**Front-end performance for web designers and front-end developers**](https://www.readability.com/articles/0jhfrya9)<br />
The incomparable Harry Roberts from [CSS Wizardry](http://csswizardry.com/) takes an in-depth look at front-end performance and makes some good suggestions.

[**Dumb software**](http://warpspire.com/posts/dumb-software/)<br />
I just love this post by [Kyle Neath](http://warpspire.com/) who works at [Github](http://github.com). Complexity is rampant in software design these days and sometimes it just feels right to use tried, true and predictable tools.

[**Redesigning Google: how Larry Page engineered a beautiful revolution**](https://www.readability.com/articles/bjm1ddo6)<br />
Google web and mobile apps are looking really great these days. [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/) takes a look at how Google co-founder Larry Page steered his company in this direction after tasking over as CEO.
