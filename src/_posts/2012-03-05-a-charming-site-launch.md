title: 'A charming site launch'

---

My friend and jewelry designer Jodi Bloom is launching a new version of her <a href="http://so-charmed.com/">So Charmed website</a> this week. Jodi is a terrific <a href="http://thedesignfarm.com/">graphic designer</a>, <a href="http://www.thebluemoon.com/4/sum98ficbloom.html">story teller</a> and talented designer of off beat jewelry for&mdash;as she describes&mdash;punks and princesses. Each piece has a story behind it. I helped her launch an earlier version of the site years ago that was static html. After a year or so trying the Shopify e-commerce platform she wanted to go back to platform that better enabled the story telling aspect of her work. Since she was already using Wordpress to publish her <a href="http://blog.so-charmed.com/">blog</a> I suggested we develop a custom Wordpress theme and publishing mechanism to allow her to use Wordpress for the new version of her site.

<a href="http://so-charmed.com"><img src="http://www.digitaltroubador.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/sc-2012.png" alt="" title="sc-2012" width="450" height="444" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-609" /></a>

Jodi designed the interface and I developed the Wordpress Theme and publishing routine. Using the <a href="http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/">Advanced Custom Fields</a> plugin and the <a href="http://www.tipsandtricks-hq.com/wordpress-simple-paypal-shopping-cart-plugin-768">Simple Paypal Shopping Cart</a> plugin made for a simple and easy administrative user experience to publish new pieces, tell the story behind them and make them available for purchase via Paypal. I also integrated liking a piece on Facebook and Pinning to Pinterest into the product posts.
