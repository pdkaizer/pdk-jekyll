title: 'Rapid CMS enabled site development with Wordpress'

---


A few months ago my friend <a href="http://www.johnberndt.org/">John Berndt</a> asked me if I would come into his company <a href="http://www.berndtgroup.net/">The Berndt Group</a> to do an overview of Wordpress as a rapid development platform for Content Management enabled websites.  The Berndt Group primarily does large scale commercial CMS implementation using platforms such as <a href="http://www.sitecore.net/">Site Corps</a> and <a href="http://www.ektron.com/">Ektron</a> and has been looking for a rapid less expensive solution for smaller project. So, last friday I went in and gave the presentation below.
