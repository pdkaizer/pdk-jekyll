One of the cookbooks I received this year is [Chef Thomas Keller's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Keller) [Bouchon Bakery](http://bouchonbakery.com/). Looking through it initially, a recipe for Bacon & cheddar cheese scone jumped out so I decided to give it a try. As I did with [this post](/the-best-buttermilk-biscuits/) when I first made Chef Keller's amazing Buttermilk biscuits, here are some thoughts on my first crack at making these.

Having never made scones before I wasn't sure what to expect. The recipe is relatively easy, though like all of Chef Keller's recipe's requires a certain level of precision.

First all the ingredients get assemble and into a stand mixer. After mixing and shaping to dough is ready to shape, wrap in plastic and into the fridge for a few hours before cutting into block and then freezing overnight.

The next morning I took half the scones out, brushed the top with some cream and an additional sprinkle of grated cheddar and then baked to golden goodness.

These are not your typical sweet scones. There are a very rich savory treat that was well worth the effort.
