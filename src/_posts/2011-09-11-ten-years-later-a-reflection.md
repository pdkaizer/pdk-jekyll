title: 'Ten years later: A reflection'

---

<p>Ten years ago today, I was on vacation with my sister, brother in law and a couple of friends on the outer banks of North Carolina. We had been there 3 or 4 days already and until that day the most eventful thing on our minds was <a href="http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/159046/">a shark attack</a> that had happened the week before we arrived and whether the wind would pick up so we could go windsurfing. As the events of the day unfolded, the <a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/r/rem/its+the+end+of+the+world+as+we+know+it_10240320.html">REM song &#8220;Itâ€™s the end of the world as we know it&#8221;</a> kept running through my head, along with many other emotions including, of course, fear. I knew that this was a day that would transform the world.</p>

<p>Ten years later:<br />
I wish that we could be transformed to care more about the most marginalized people around the world. </p>

<p>Ten years later:<br />
I wish that this nation could be transformed to better care for its poorest and most vulnerable citizens. </p>

<p>Ten years later:<br />
I hope and pray that the human family can be transformed and stop hurting each other in the name of God and spiritual beliefs. </p>

<p>This would be the best way to honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice on that day. </p>
