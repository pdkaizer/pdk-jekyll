title: 'Are decorative design elements going out of style?'

---


A few days ago Netmagazine published <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/features/big-question-are-decorative-design-elements-going-out-style">Big question: are decorative design elements going out of style?</a> where they ask a number of prominent digital designers their view on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph">skeuomorphic design</a>. The day before the Fast Company design blog had <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670760/will-apples-tacky-software-design-philosophy-cause-a-revolt">Will Apple's Tacky Software-Design Philosophy Cause A Revolt?</a> These two excellent pieces got me thinking about my views on what essentially amounts to mimicking the look of a real world objects in digital design elements.

While I get that the use of these visual metaphors creates an understanding of the use of an interface for the end user I do find an over dependence on this troubling. I - for example - have refused to use the default Notes app in iOS on my iPhone and iPad because of the fake legal pad look and the terrible typography. The <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670760/will-apples-tacky-software-design-philosophy-cause-a-revolt">Fast Company article</a> notes that even at Apple there is growing discontent about the insistence on this design approach.

What are your thought about this?
